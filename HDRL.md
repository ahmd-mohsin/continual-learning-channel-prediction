## Hierarchichal Deep Reinforcement Learning for Feedback Scheduling

I want to submit a paper in ICML 2025 with the topic of hierarchichal deep reinforcement learning for feedback scheduling. The idea is that for current wireless channels , what they do is that to estimate the channel, they send pilot signals and then recieve a feedback from those pilot signals to calculate the error. This feedback can increase a lot in the wireless signals especialy in cell free massive mimo systems and we need to compress this feeedback as well as schedule this sending of feedback to cater for the high feedback overhead issue.

First, I need to motiavte the problem that why is feedback scheduling important? Can we scehdule feedback or does the feedback need to have a fixed schedule?

First I will explain the feedback overhead of this problem -- , what is feedback overhead?

Inter Compute Bandwidths for I/Q samples and precoder:
Calculation error signal at the reciever, how much si the feedback voerhead

After I explain this problem, I have to come up with a solution, Hierarchichal DRL based feedback compression. 

Now this will have 2 further breakdowns.

1. Feedback scheduling. How do we deciede when to send the feedback for the channel update? Assuming a wideband channel what we can do is that, the channel does not chnage much but what is the parameter on which we update that when to schedule the feedback to avoid redundant feedbacks? when the channel is changing much we can go for faster feedback but when the channel appears fairly static, we can tone down the feedback scheduling.

2. The next thing we can do is to compress the feedback we are sending but compression based on the channel capcaity. Channel capacity aware compression is the go to. Using Hierarchichal RL, we can take feedback to asses the capcaity of the chanenl and then quantize the feedback buits according to that, extracting important information and checking how much can we compress and send over.


KEY ISSUES.

1. Dataset? where do we bring the dataset for this. There is a publically available MIMO dataset can we use that or do we create that using MATLAB.

2. Is it solving a problem or it is not solving a problem?

3. It is overly complex or are solving it the correct way. Give me a detailed feedback on this idea:

### Feasibility & novelty at a glance  

| Aspect | Current status | Feedback |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Motivation** | Overhead of CSI feedback in cell‑free massive‑MIMO is real and topical. | Emphasise *quantitative* stakes: e.g. uplink budget ≈ **12 Gb s‑1** for a 256‑antenna FDD cell‑free array with 20 MHz × 100 RBs if every UE reports full CSI each slot. Anchor the reader with hard numbers, not just “a lot”. |
| **Literature gap** | RL has been used for user/beam scheduling and for CSI compression ‑ but almost never for *joint* adaptive‑rate scheduling + rate‑distortion‑aware compression in a **hierarchical** RL (HRL) framework. | Make that gap explicit by contrasting to recent single‑level DRL schedulers citeturn0search3 and DL auto‑encoder feedback schemes citeturn0academia11. |
| **ML contribution** | Hierarchical agent: high‑level policy decides *when* to feed back, low‑level policy decides *how many bits* (or codebook rank) to send. | ICML cares more about ML novelty than comms heuristics. Provide (i) an abstraction showing why HRL > flat RL for this Markov decision process (temporal abstraction, two‑time‑scale rewards), and (ii) theoretical insight—e.g. regret bounds for semi‑MDP option‑critic. |
| **Dataset** | Unclear. | 1) Use an open‑source measured MIMO dataset (e.g. DeepMIMO, CDL‑A/B) for reproducible offline RL; 2) Augment with Quadriga/NYUSIM simulation for scalability; 3) Release your own MATLAB‑generated cell‑free traces to strengthen contribution. |
| **Evaluation** | Not yet defined. | Target three metrics: *throughput* gain vs. baseline static feedback, *feedback‑bit rate* reduction, and *NMSE* of reconstructed CSI. Compare to: (a) periodic fixed‑rate schemes, (b) LSTM‑based compression (CsiNet‑LSTM), (c) state‑of‑the‑art transformer compressors citeturn0academia11. |
| **Complexity** | HRL can explode: two critics, large joint action space. | Keep the hierarchy minimal: **Option‑level** (send/skip) + **bit‑budget level** (discrete set of compression ratios). Train low‑level policy with off‑policy SAC; train high‑level option policy with PPO over temporally‑extended actions. |
| **Real‑time viability** | DRL inference at UE may be heavy. | Offload scheduling policy to BS (global view, bigger compute); keep only lightweight compressor at UE (shared auto‑encoder weights). |
| **Novelty claim** | “First HRL for feedback scheduling.” | Strengthen by adding capacity‑aware quantisation head that adapts to instantaneous UE uplink SNR → bridges information‑theoretic rate‑distortion with RL. |

## Detailed recommendations

1. **Sharpen the problem statement**  
   *Define feedback overhead precisely*:  
   \[
      R_{\text{FB}} = \frac{B_\text{bits}\,N_\text{ant}\,N_\text{sub}}{T_\text{slot}}
   \]
   where \(B_\text{bits}\) is bits per complex coefficient. Show that \(R_{\text{FB}}\) can exceed UE uplink capacity at modest bandwidths.

2. **Why hierarchical?**  
   * High‑level agent operates on a slow clock (\(K\) slots) and outputs **option** \(O_t\in\{\text{skip},\text{send}\}\).  
   * Low‑level agent, triggered when \(O_t=\text{send}\), chooses compression ratio \(c\in\{1/4,1/8,\dots\}\).  
   * This decouples long‑horizon dynamics (channel coherence) from fast actions (bit allocation) → reduces credit‑assignment variance.

3. **Reward design**  
   \[
      r_t = \underbrace{\alpha\,\mathrm{SE}_t}_{\text{spectral efficiency}} \;-\;
             \underbrace{\beta\,R^{\text{FB}}_t}_{\text{feedback cost}} \;-\;
             \underbrace{\gamma\,\text{NMSE}_t}_{\text{CSI error}}
   \]
   Tune \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\) via population‑based training or inverse RL to hit operator KPI targets.

4. **Baseline suite**  
   | Scheme | Sends every \(T\) slots | Fixed bits | Adaptive bits | RL? |
   |--------|------------------------|------------|---------------|------|
   | Periodic | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
   | Event‑triggered (variance) | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
   | CsiNet‑LSTM | ✗ | ✗ (fixed ratio) | ✗ | ✗ |
   | Flat SAC scheduler | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
   | **Proposed HRL** | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |

5. **Complexity mitigation**  
   * Use discrete action branching (BranchDQN / Branch‑SAC) instead of large joint spaces.  
   * Distil the low‑level network into a small LUT‑style policy for UE deployment.

6. **Datasets & simulation**  
   * **DeepMIMO scenario O1** gives measured \(28\) GHz outdoor channel snapshots—plug‑and‑play for offline RL.  
   * For cell‑free, extend Quadriga “3D‑UMa” to >20 APs; publish code to regenerate traces (boosts reproducibility).  
   * Optionally generate synthetic channel‑error feedback using your existing Gaussian‑Splatting simulator.

7. **Potential pitfalls**  
   * **Non‑stationarity**: channel statistics vary across mobility classes; consider meta‑RL or fine‑tuning stages.  
   * **Sample complexity**: HRL may need >10⁶ steps—run large‑scale offline RL first, then fine‑tune online.  
   * **Review fit**: ICML reviewers will ask, *“What does ML community learn from this?”* Provide either (i) a new HRL algorithm for sparse‑cost MDPs or (ii) theoretical analysis of option‑level optimality under rate‑distortion constraints.

### Bottom line

*The idea is solid and timely*. To elevate it to **ICML calibre**:

1. **Ground the motivation in hard numbers** (uplink budget vs. required CSI bits).  
2. **Frame a general ML problem**: hierarchical decision‑making under coupled communication‑cost and task‑accuracy trade‑offs.  
3. **Deliver both empirical gains and ML insight**—e.g. show that temporal abstraction in HRL provably reduces policy variance in environments with two‑time‑scale dynamics.

With these refinements—and a reproducible dataset—your proposal can stand out in the 2025 ICML communications‑ML track. Good luck!
